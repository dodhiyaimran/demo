# Laravel Module Skeleton

This directory contains a simplified skeleton demonstrating how you might structure
an admin module for user, category, project and inquiry management using
Laravel with Blade and Tailwind. It does not include a full Laravel
installation due to environment limitations.

## Features

- Authentication scaffold expected from Laravel Breeze.
- CRUD controllers and Blade views for Users, Categories and Projects.
- Inquiry listing and contact form handling.
- Sample migrations defining necessary tables.

To use this module in a real application, copy the contents into a fresh
Laravel 11 project with Breeze installed and run the migrations.
