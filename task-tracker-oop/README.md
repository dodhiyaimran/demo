# Task Tracker OOP Version

This directory contains a simple object-oriented rewrite of the Task Tracker example. It uses Bootstrap 5 for styling and organizes core functionality in PHP classes.

## Setup

1. Create a MySQL database `task_tracker` and import the schema from the original module (`task-tracker/schema.sql`).
2. Adjust credentials in `inc/Database.php` if necessary.
3. Place the folder on a PHP-enabled server and open `login.php` for the admin panel or `mobile_login.php` for user login.

The MSG91 OTP integration is represented as a placeholder in `inc/Otp.php`.
